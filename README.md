### Architecture

This project consists of:

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: FastAPI with Python
- **Embedding and Reranking**: 
  - CLIP for image-text embeddings
  - Sentence Transformers for dense embeddings
  - SPLADE for sparse embeddings
  - BGE Reranker for final ranking against user query
- **LLM Output**: Claude 3.5 Sonnet for natural language
- **Vector DB**: Pinecone Dense and Sparse indices
- **Deployment**: Railway (backend) + Vercel (frontend)

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 18+
- Pinecone API key
- Anthropic API key

### Backend Setup

1. **Clone and navigate to backend:**
```bash
cd backend
```

2. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Set environment variables:**
```bash
PINECONE_API_KEY=your_pinecone_api_key
PERSONAL_ANTHROPIC=your_anthropic_api_key
```

4. **Run the server:**
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

### Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend
```

2. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Set environment variables:**
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

4. **Run the development server:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

##  How It Works

### Hybrid Search Architecture

1. **Dense Search**: Uses sentence transformers to capture semantic meaning
2. **Sparse Search**: Uses SPLADE to capture specific keywords and phrases  
3. **Image Search**: Uses CLIP to understand visual context from venue images

### Search Process

```python
# Example of the hybrid search process
query = "romantic dinner with city views"

# 1. Generate embeddings for all three modalities
clip_embedding = clip_model.encode_text(query)
dense_embedding = metadata_model.encode(query)
sparse_embedding = sparse_model.encode(query)

# 2. Search across all indices
image_results = image_index.query(clip_embedding)
dense_results = dense_index.query(dense_embedding)
sparse_results = sparse_index.query(sparse_embedding)

# 3. Merge and rerank results
final_results = rerank(merge_results(image_results, dense_results, sparse_results))
```

## Deployment

### Backend (Railway)
The backend is automatically deployed to Railway with the configuration in `railway.json`.

### Frontend (Vercel)
The frontend can be deployed to Vercel with the configuration in `vercel.json`.

## Original Solution

The original datathon solution was implemented in Jupyter Notebook (`datathon.ipynb`) and demonstrated:

- RAG recommendation system for NYC venues
- Hybrid dense and sparse search
- Image-text understanding with CLIP
- Advanced ranking algorithms

This web application brings that solution to life with a production-ready interface.
