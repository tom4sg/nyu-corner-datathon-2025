## Overview

This project consists of:

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: FastAPI with Python
- **Embedding and Reranking**: 
  - CLIP for image-text embeddings
  - Sentence Transformers for dense embeddings
  - SPLADE for sparse embeddings
  - BGE Reranker for final ranking against user query
- **LLM Output**: Claude 3.5 Sonnet for natural language
- **Vector DB**: Pinecone Dense and Sparse indices
- **Deployment**: Railway (backend) + Vercel (frontend)

### Pseudocode: Hybrid Search Function
```python3
# 1. Generate embeddings
clip_embedding   = clip_model.encode_text(query)       # CLIP (image/text)
sparse_embedding = sparse_model.embed(query)           # SPLADE (sparse)
dense_embedding  = metadata_model.encode(query)        # SentenceTransformer (dense)

# 2. Query Pinecone indexes (async)
image_q  = pinecone_image_query(clip_embedding)
sparse_q = pinecone_sparse_query(sparse_embedding)
dense_q  = pinecone_dense_query(dense_embedding)

image_results, sparse_results, dense_results = await asyncio.gather(
    image_q, sparse_q, dense_q
)

# 3. Merge hybrid search results
hybrid_results = merge_matches(dense_results, sparse_results, image_results)

# 4. Rerank with BGE
reranked = pc.inference.rerank(
    model="bge-reranker-v2-m3",
    query=query,
    documents=list(hybrid_results.keys()),
    top_n=8
)
```

## Deployment

### Backend (Railway)
The backend is automatically deployed to Railway with the configuration in `railway.json`.

### Frontend (Vercel)
The frontend can be deployed to Vercel with the configuration in `vercel.json`.

## Original Solution

The original datathon solution was implemented in Jupyter Notebook (`datathon.ipynb`) and demonstrated:

- RAG recommendation system for NYC venues
- Hybrid dense and sparse search
- Image-text understanding with CLIP
- FAISS index for vector storage and retrieval
